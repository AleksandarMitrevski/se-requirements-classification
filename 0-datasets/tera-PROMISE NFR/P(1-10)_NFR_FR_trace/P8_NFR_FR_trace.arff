% The FR attribute is the set of the functional requirements specified in the project (type F)
% The requirement number corresponds to the NFR data set project requirements according to the order
% they appear there. Since the non-functional requirements appear first in this data set, the functional
% requirements numbering do not begin at 1 (but exactly in the position the functional requirements
% begin). For Project 8 in the NFR data set the first 73 requirements listed are nonfunctional, so 
% the functional requirements number starts with R74.

% The attributes below are the set of non-functional requirements (types A,L,LF,MN,O,PE,SC,SE,US,FT,PO).
